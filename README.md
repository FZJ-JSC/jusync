
# JUSYNC

A high-performance C++ middleware library that provides seamless communication between ANARI (ANAlytic Rendering Interface) applications and USD (Universal Scene Description) data streams via ZeroMQ messaging. This middleware enables real-time streaming of USD files, textures, and mesh data over network connections, making it ideal for collaborative workflows, live preview systems, and distributed rendering pipelines.

## Overview

The JUSYNC Middleware acts as a bridge between USD content creation tools and ANARI-based rendering applications. It implements a robust ZeroMQ ROUTER/DEALER communication pattern to handle file transfers with hash verification, automatic USD format conversion, and comprehensive mesh data extraction capabilities.

## Public API Reference

### Core Classes

#### AnariUsdMiddleware

```


## Network Protocol

### ZeroMQ ROUTER/DEALER Pattern

**File Transfer Message Format**:
1. Client Identity (automatic)
2. Filename
3. File Content (binary)
4. SHA-256 Hash

**Simple Message Format**:
1. Client Identity (automatic)
2. Message Content (JSON/text)

### Client Example (Python)

```

import zmq
import hashlib

context = zmq.Context()
socket = context.socket(zmq.DEALER)
socket.connect("tcp://localhost:5556")

# Send USD file

with open("model.usd", "rb") as f:
data = f.read()

file_hash = hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()
socket.send_multipart([
b"model.usd",
data,
file_hash.encode()
])

```

## USD Processing Capabilities

- **Triangulation**: Converts polygonal faces to triangles for real-time rendering
- **Coordinate Transformation**: Transforms vertices and normals using proper world transformation matrices
- **UV Coordinate Handling**: Searches for UV coordinates across multiple possible primvar names
- **Texture Processing**: Creates textures from raw buffer data with gradient extraction capabilities
- **Format Detection**: Supports multiple USD formats (.usd, .usda, .usdc, .usdz)
- **Content Preprocessing**: Fixes common USD content issues for better compatibility

## Error Handling
